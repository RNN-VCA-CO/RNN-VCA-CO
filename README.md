# RNN-VCA-CO
Using RNNs with annealing to solve combinatorial optimization problems

Summary:

- The data we used for our paper can be found in the directory "Data".

- The code we used to run Variational Classical Annealing (VCA) can be found in "VCA".

- The code we used to run Simulated Annealing (SA) can be found in "SA".

Note:

- 'VCA_Max-Cut.ipynb' and 'VCA_NSP.ipynb' files use tensorflow v2 with latest numpy version.
- The .py files in directory 'TSP_code' use tensorflow v1 with an older numpy version (v1.16) for compatibility.
