# RNN-VCA-CO
This code is used to produce the results of our paper [`Supplementing RNNs with annealing to Solve Optimization Problems`](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2632-2153/acb895). We use both Vanilla and Dilated RNNs to solve the Maximum-Cut, Nurse Scheduling and Traveling Salesman Problems.

This code was build on top of the code in this repository: https://github.com/VectorInstitute/VariationalNeuralAnnealing

## `Summary`

- The data we used for our paper can be found in the directory `Data`.

- The code we used to run Variational Classical Annealing (VCA) can be found in `VCA`.

- The code we used to run Simulated Annealing (SA) can be found in `SA`.

## `Note`

- The .py files in the VCA directory use tensorflow v2 along with latest numpy version.
